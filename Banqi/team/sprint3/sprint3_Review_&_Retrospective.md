## Review 1 (Start of sprint)
We met with the product owner after Sprint 2 to get some feedback regarding our performance and to determine what tasks/epics are to be prioritized for Sprint 3. 
* We recieved good feedback regarding the presentation, points for improvement include: being more presentable/professional when presenting. 
* We discussed with the PO how we broke up this sprint into 2 sub sprints. We received help on which epics to prioritize during both sub sprints. One of the changes requested to be made was that registration to the platform be bumped from weeks 3 and 4 to weeks 1 and 2.
* Weeks 3 and 4 will now be focused on the networking aspect of the online game.

## Review 2 (end of 1st 2 weeks)
*Data base is working properly and hosted on Microsoft Azure.*
## Review 3 (end of sprint)
*Our game is complete with the features the P.O told us to prioritize.*
